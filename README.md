## Overview

An app for managing the balance of a shared account by tracking income and
expenses.

### Why?

I intend for this project to be a demonstration my own specifcation-driven
development practices. In general I follow this process:

1. Sketching: I figure out what the tool can do
2. Blocking: I break my sketch down into major components
3. Specifying: I define the rules for how each component works
4. Verifying: I define test cases for each of the rules
