### Why?

I intend for this project to be a demonstration my own specifcation-driven
development practices. In general I follow process with the following layers:

- Sketching: I figure out what the tool can do
- Blocking: I break my sketch down into major components
- Specifying: I define the rules for how each component works
- Implementing: I write the implementation to match the specification
