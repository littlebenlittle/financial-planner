<h3 id='quick_summary'>Quick Summary</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The first goal when using a new tool is to explore what you can do with the
tool. This is not an intrinsic propery of the tool, but rather a harmony between
tool and person. What another person might do with that tool is irrelevant--what
can <strong>you</strong> do with it?</p>

<h2 id='the_tool:_rust_and_yew'>The Tool: Rust and Yew</h2>

<p>Yew is a reactive framework for the rust programming language. It allows
developers to make use of rust&#8217;s powerful static type checker to build robust
front-end applications. The explicit memory management of rust can help identify
and debug performance problems that may be obfuscated by other frontend
frameworks written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Building the financial planner application with rust and Yew started with
exploring what these tools can do. After some fiddling, I was able to create
a UI that enables the user to submit income and expense forms that are then
recorded in the transaction log. I also configure a histogram that plotted daily
income and expnses in a given date range.</p>

<p>At this point the app was mostly doing what I expected with a few hiccups. These
hiccups are when I really started to need to think about <em>what</em> each compoment
of the UI was supposed to do and how it interacts with the computations being
performed in the background.</p>
